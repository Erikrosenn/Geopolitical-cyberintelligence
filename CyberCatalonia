Cyberattack disrupts water utility services in Catalonia

Aigües de Mataró, a municipal water supplier near Barcelona, was hit by a cyberattack this week, disrupting its corporate systems and website. The breach did not affect the delivery of drinking water or its quality control infrastructure, the company confirmed.

The incident, discovered on Monday, has been reported to Catalonia’s regional police and cybersecurity agency. Aigües de Mataró, which serves the coastal town of Mataró (population ~130,000), activated contingency measures and is now working with authorities to restore affected systems.

The utility warned that customer data, including financial and personal information, may have been exposed. Clients were urged to remain alert to potential phishing attempts using stolen data.

While the exact nature of the cyberattack has not been disclosed, the event aligns with a broader trend of ransomware targeting critical infrastructure. The company noted service delays in billing and administration are likely until full recovery is achieved.

Spain has faced repeated ransomware incidents in recent years, including high-profile attacks on hospitals and municipal systems. In 2023, thousands of medical appointments were cancelled following an attack on Barcelona’s main hospital. Spain is a member of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative.

TLDR: A cyberattack hit Aigües de Mataró, a water utility near Barcelona, affecting its IT systems but not water quality. Customer data may be compromised; officials warn of possible phishing attempts.
