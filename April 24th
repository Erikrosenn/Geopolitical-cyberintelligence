Cloudflare reports zero government-led internet shutdowns in Q1 2025

For the first time in a year, no new government-mandated internet shutdowns were recorded globally in Q1 2025, according to a report from Cloudflare. The company, along with watchdog group NetBlocks, has long tracked digital blackouts tied to elections, protests, and military conflict.

This marks only the third such quarter in three years. Cloudflare suggests the drop may be due to fewer national exams and disputed elections, historically common triggers for shutdowns.

Despite the pause, Cloudflare warned that the trend may be short-lived, especially in countries like Iraq and Syria, which have previously restricted access to curb exam cheating.

NetBlocks director Alp Toker cited two key reasons for the downturn: the closure of USAID and increased compliance by tech platforms with government censorship. He noted that USAID-funded NGOs, once active on social media, have shut down—reducing governments’ incentives to impose blanket shutdowns.

Toker added that platforms like X (formerly Twitter) are more willing to restrict accounts at government request, citing recent Turkish takedowns targeting critics and boycott campaigns.

Outside of government action, several outages still occurred due to natural disasters, infrastructure damage, and cyberattacks. Fires in Los Angeles and Haiti, storms in Ireland and Réunion, and an earthquake in Myanmar all led to temporary disruptions.

Cloudflare’s network spans 330+ cities in over 125 countries, providing insights into both man-made and natural causes of internet outages.

TLDR: No new government-backed internet shutdowns occurred in Q1 2025, a rare drop attributed to fewer exams/elections and tighter social media controls. Natural disasters and infrastructure damage still caused disruptions.
