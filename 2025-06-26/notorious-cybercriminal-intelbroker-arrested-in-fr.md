Kai West, a prolific cybercriminal better known for operating under the moniker “IntelBroker,” was arrested in France earlier this year and faces federal charges for allegedly stealing data from more than 40 organizations during a two-year period, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

Federal prosecutors unsealed a four-count indictment charging West, a British national, with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, accessing a protected computer to obtain information and wire fraud. The United States is seeking his extradition for the charges, which each carry maximum sentences of five to 20 years in prison.

“Kai West, an alleged serial hacker, is charged for a nefarious, years-long scheme to steal victim’s [sic] data and sell it for millions in illicit funds, causing more than $25 million in damages worldwide,” FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher G. Raia said in a statement.

The 25-year-old conspired with members of a cybercrime group he led to steal data from businesses and offered it for sale from about January 2023 until his arrest in February 2025, according to prosecutors.

West is accused of offering data stolen from U.S.-based companies for sale at least 41 times. Victims include a U.S.-based telecommunications company, municipal health care provider and an internet service provider.

West allegedly sold data, including customer information, they stole from the U.S.-based telecommunications provider by accessing an improperly configured server.

Prosecutors also accuse West of attempting to sell data stolen from a municipal health care provider, which included patient data such as names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health plan and employer information.

The Justice Department didn’t name the health care organization, but said West offered the data for sale in a post on March 6, 2023. That same day, a person using the IntelBroker moniker published data stolen from DC Health Link, the capital’s health insurance exchange, exposing personal information on Washington’s powerbrokers and a prominent former defense official.

Of West’s 158 public posts on the online forum called Forum-1, 16 included a specific asking price for stolen data totaling nearly $2.5 million. West also allegedly solicited a negotiated sales price for stolen data 25 times and offered to distribute stolen data for free in 117 posts.

The Justice Department said IntelBroker was identified as the owner of Forum-1 from August 2024 to January 2025.

West’s arrest preceded a more recent wave of cybercrime crackdowns across the globe, including a surge of takedowns, seizures, indictments and arrests.
