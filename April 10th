Chinese officials confirmed their role in a series of cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure during a secret meeting in Geneva last December, highlighting growing tensions between the U.S. and China.
The attacks, dubbed Volt Typhoon, targeted U.S. ports, airports, and utilities, with Chinese officials linking the intrusions to increased U.S. support for Taiwan.
The remarks, while indirect, were interpreted by U.S. officials as a warning about Beijing’s willingness to escalate its cyber capabilities in response to U.S. involvement in the Taiwan dispute. 
The acknowledgment marks a departure from previous Chinese denials, signaling Beijing’s growing assertiveness in cyber warfare.

In the aftermath of the Geneva summit, U.S.-China relations have worsened, with both nations entangled in a deepening trade war and cyber conflict. The U.S. government has been bolstering its cybersecurity defenses, even as it faces staffing cuts within its agencies.
Chinese hackers have also been linked to breaches of U.S. telecommunications networks, raising concerns about national security.
The meeting underscored the risks of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure, with experts warning that such actions may be seen as acts of war by the U.S., particularly in the context of a potential Taiwan conflict.

TLDR: Chinese officials admitted their involvement in cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, linking them to U.S. support for Taiwan. This marks a significant escalation in the ongoing cyber conflict between the two nations.
