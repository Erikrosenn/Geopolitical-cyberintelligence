Cybercriminals aren’t so different from the rest of us — they live in the real world, and their spending and investment habits, though funded through crime, can look surprisingly ordinary. Luxury cars and lavish vacations may still grab headlines, but those perks are reserved for the most elite cybercriminals.

In reality, everyday businesses — like pizza delivery, construction supplies, or tattoo parlors — are supported by the fruits of the labor that comes from a life of cybercrime.

An extensive investigation by Sophos X-Ops, pulled from thousands of posts on two Russian-language and three English-language cybercrime forums, uncovered the dark underbelly of illegal schemes cybercriminals use to reinvest their money. Yet, researchers also discovered a vast community of chatty cybercriminals seeking to help each other launder their money with more common business pursuits.

According to John Shier, field chief information security officer of threat intelligence at Sophos, alleged cybercriminals on these forums are pursuing an immense range of businesses, investment proposals and startup ideas.

“A lot of this cybercrime is fueled by crypto, and it’s kind of useless in the real world,” Shier told CyberScoop. “So, they need to be able to move that cryptocurrency into some sort of fiat, some sort of valuable something that they can actually spend in the real world.”

The discussion of legitimate businesses as a vehicle for laundering money is brazen, he said. Some guides and detailed instructions shared on these forums also reveal how extensively cybercriminals collaborate to diversify and develop specialized ways to funnel their money.

Businesses that cybercriminals prop up with their ill-gotten gains include everything from drive-thru coffee shops to real estate, education, pharmaceuticals, construction, software development and — wait for it — cybersecurity companies and services.

Users on these forums proposed selling spyware to pentesters and corporations, developing exploits or finding vulnerabilities in local businesses’ networks to then turn that into an opportunity to sell protective services. “I accidentally found myself in this situation, raised a lot of money and got a regular client,” an unnamed user wrote, according to Sophos.

Researchers also observed proposals for security startups specializing in vulnerability research and a hash decryption service using a commercial cloud provider. One user recommended an investment in a prominent cybersecurity vendor.

“Irony aside, this raises the concerning possibility that threat actors could become shareholders of a company that tracks and disrupts threat actors,” Sophos X-Ops researchers said in the report.

“It is concerning that you’d have people with motivations that are criminal, that are investing in businesses that are supposed to be helping organizations withstand cybercrime,” Shier said.

While it’s a positive when someone leaves a life of cybercrime behind, Shier said he doubts that’s the case for individuals communicating within the criminal underground. The potential for insider-type activity is real, where “the protectors are actually the ones that are in the ski masks and pointing a gun at you,” he said.

Some of the guides Sophos found covered step-by-step methods for investing in gold or diamonds, establishing shell companies, money laundering, and importing and exporting.

Researchers described some business interests as “gray,” including pornography and gambling.

Outright illegal activities were abundant on these forums as well. This includes bots, pyramid schemes, sex work, drugs, tax evasion, insider trading and reinvesting in cybercrime.

“Invest it in the business that brought you this income. It’s obvious,” one user said in a forum, according to Sophos.

Researchers observed multiple investment opportunities for malware and campaigns already in progress or development, including botnets, infostealers, phishing tools, SIM-swapping and a year-old DDoS-related project.
