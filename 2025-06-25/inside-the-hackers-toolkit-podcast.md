There is no question that companies are in the sights of would-be criminals looking to exploit them. While companies look at solutions and training to help keep the perimeter secure, the biggest fail point is often the employees, AKA the human element.

In this Threatpost podcast, sponsored by Egress, we sit down with Jack Chapman to discuss the steps and tactics that companies can take to stay one step ahead of their adversaries.

– Weaknesses that attackers look to exploit
– Evolution of toolkits
– Securing MFA and more

Jeff Esposito: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the latest edition of the Threatpost Podcast. Today we are joined by Jack Chapman of Egress. He is the VP of threat intelligence at Egress and is tasked with deeply understanding the evolving cyber threat landscape to remain one step ahead of cybercriminals.

Leveraging these insights and his extensive r&d skill set, Jack oversees threat intelligence for Egress. Jack previously co-founded anti-phishing company Aquila AI and served as its chief technology officer, working closely with the UK intelligence and cyber agency GCHQ to develop cutting-edge product capabilities. Aquila AI was acquired by Egress in 2021. Jack, welcome to the podcast. How are you doing today?

Jack Chapman: Good, Jeff. Pleased to be here.

JE: It’s always good to see you. Hopefully, everything’s going well over in the UK today. So in looking at your background, I wanted to see if we could dive a bit into the darker side of cybersecurity and look inside the attacker’s mindset. Is that something you’re okay with?

JC: That is my bread and butter, is what I do on a daily basis, is my favorite topic.

JE: Well, that’s a good thing because then we’re gonna dive into it a bit. So what, you know, what are some of the weaknesses that attackers look to exploit in companies?

JC: The number one is people. It’s very much from attackers were sort of the crime as a service ecosystems matured, they’ve gone on to very much return on investment model. And the vast majority of attackers are all very financially driven. And as part of that, they sort of evaluating their TTPs and how they attack organizations. And oddly enough, when we say out loud, it makes sense, it’s a lot cheaper and easier to target a human than it is to invest half a million dollars into the next zero-day. So it’s very much human-focused, and then growing from there that enables the other attacks.

JE: So it seems like no matter what the year changes, it’s always going to be that human element that’s the biggest problem for companies.

JC: Yeah, absolutely. And it almost looked like it was changing a couple of years ago, but then organizations and so as a whole, we’ve matured our cyber posture, we’ve implemented sort of the OWASP, top 10, with pen testing and password policies, which is great to see. And it’s almost like we’ve focused the attackers back on the traditional piece, so we’re back to people.

JE: And it’s like, is it just phishing? Are there other things like I know, we’ve seen stuff like people losing USB has been the in the drops that we’ve seen in the past. But is it just phishing? That’s the easiest layer in are there other options of that?

JC: I think phishing is the vast majority, but you’ve got the fringe elements like the social engineering, the phishing, smishing, and all these other great marketing terms that we’ve got in cyber as a whole, which doesn’t, they don’t drive me mad at all, honestly. But then going on from that, we are starting to see more things around breach replay attacks, and the amount of data breaches individuals and organizations are in and that that’s the other main channel into it seems to be phishing and breach replay at the moment.

JE: Okay, now, once the attackers are in, you know, how have the toolkits evolved and like what organizations need to be on top of?

JC: I think the two main ways they’ve evolved are in sophistication and automation. So even though we’re using the same language for all of these attacks, they have moved on a bit more. So just an example of this one, one I saw actually, the other week, was a phishing attack that when the user clicked on the link, it would automatically look up their MX record, to see which payload it should show the user, which is a great bit of innovation from the attackers point of view, but it makes it on our side quite difficult at times, to protect.
