Join us for this on-demand Threatpost Webinar with Keeper Security. In this on-demand Threatpost Town Hall, We will discuss topics related to challenges organizations face protecting sensitive information while maintaining access to remote systems. For example, developers may need to access servers in the cloud or in a data center from their desktop, or a professional group (law firm, accountancies, consultants) may need to share sensitive documents from home offices.

Connecting to Remote Servers is Insecure

Because they fail to incorporate the principle of least privilege – access is only regulated by passwords. Auditing is not possible. Clients are cumbersome, prone to security gaps, and pose one more area to be managed, upgraded, and patched by IT.

VPNs Fail to Provide Adequate Security

Because VPNs don’t follow the principle of least privilege, they are not compatible with a zero-trust strategy. Once a user is connected, he or she has access to multiple systems, printers, servers, desktops, and fileshares. The user is inherently trusted with access to all systems behind the firewall.

SSH Connections Lack Security

Oftentimes credentials are sent via email and kept unsecured, even shared among multiple team members. The complexity and configuration difficulties of SSH connections control access as employees switch teams or leave the organization. SSH connections also fail to provide governance controls.

Webinar Speakers

Zane Bond – Senior Director of Product Management, will discuss solutions for providing DevOps and IT teams with effortless access to RDP, SSH, database and Kubernetes endpoints through a web browser.

Jeff Esposito, acting publisher for Threatpost, will moderate the session and take questions from the live audience.
