Supposed experts and mainstream media have spent the past few days hyperventilating over reports of a colossal data breach that exposed more than 16 billion credentials — a level of theft that should have defenders clutching their pearls. There’s just one inconvenient detail: the original report is curiously short on anything resembling actual evidence to support its sensational claim.

Attacks that affect billions of accounts often generate headlines and get the industry talking about ways to prevent the attack from repeating itself. Yet, the story Cybernews published Friday, which has been picked up and repeated across all manner of media in the past few days, has engendered eyerolls from cybersecurity experts for its extraordinary, dubious conclusions.

The firehose of content frames the exposed credentials as recent, singular and ultimately the largest data breach in history. Multiple incident response specialists, researchers and cybersecurity experts who spoke with CyberScoop either outright disputed those claims or questioned the data and analysis the assertion was based upon.

“These massive dumps have been announced for years, and they are always a recycled pile of credentials with a few new ones sprinkled in,” said Chester Wisniewski, director and global field CISO at Sophos.

The entire ordeal is yet another example that the business interests of cybersecurity feed on fear — both perceived and real. Stories like this often spread like wildfire because they speak to real issues and a perception that has set in across the industry.

Even if the details of Friday’s story are blown out of proportion, credential theft is a real and omnipresent threat. Credential abuse was the top initial access vector for breaches last year, according to Verizon. Infostealers were used to steal 2.1 billion credentials last year, accounting for nearly two-thirds of 3.2 billion credentials stolen from all organizations, Flashpoint said in a March report.

Yet, the limited evidence — just three screenshots — provided by Cybernews and Bob Diachenko, who is credited with “discovering” the credential breach, is a crucial sticking point. When reached for comment, Diachenko admitted that the data was cumulative records discovered since the beginning of the year and not reflective of a singular data breach.

“None of our CTI sources were able to verify that this is anything new,” and there are no raw files or verified feeds for researchers to sift through, said Rob Lee, chief of research and head of faculty at SANS Institute.

“In the intelligence world, we can’t have hyperbole,” he said. SANS isn’t invalidating the report entirely, but Lee noted: “This doesn’t pass a sniff test.”

Cyber threat intelligence relies on deep information broadly shared across the industry. Data or conclusions that aren’t actionable don’t help the community move things forward, Lee said.

Other experts had similar sentiments.

“What we’re seeing is not a singular, headline-grabbing breach at a major tech company. This cache of around 16 billion credentials reflects around 30 separate databases, stealer logs compiled over years — lots of overlap, much of it old,” said Christiaan Beek, senior director of threat analytics at Rapid7.

The result is a “recycled, inflated dataset to generate fear,” Beek said. “Infostealer malware continues to collect credentials constantly, and these aggregated dumps get recycled and reissued on various forums or platforms.”

The impact of what’s contained in the dataset, something Beek described as a “fearset,” depends on which part of the data is new or used.

Allan Liska, threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, drew the same conclusion. “By comparing released sample data against previous credential leaks we can see that most, if not all, of these credentials were from previously released password dumps. Some going back years,” he said.

“Given the formatting of the leak, it’s likely these were all from previous infostealer campaigns. There is no one campaign that they are tied to; instead, the passwords were collected from hundreds of different campaigns,” Liska said.

In an industry rife with real, indisputable problems, experts warned that misinformation or embellishment can be a disservice. At the very least, it deflects or draws attention away from verified attacks.
