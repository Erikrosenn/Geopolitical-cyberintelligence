U.S. federal authorities are warning of increased risk of Iranian cyber and related threats against healthcare and public health sector organizations - including ransomware, distributed denial-of-service and other attacks related to that nation's escalated conflicts with Israel and the United States.

Because of rising geopolitical tensions, healthcare providers are encouraged "to prepare for the likelihood of increased cyberattacks against healthcare entities," the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response warned in an advisory issued Tuesday.

Healthcare providers and other sector organizations are advised to review their vulnerability management strategy and contingency planning and adopt a heightened cyber-defense posture, said HHS ASPR's Office of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection.

"While there is no current evidence of specific targeting against healthcare and public health sector organizations, we know that the sector has historically been the victim of cyberattacks from a wide range of cyber threat actors during periods of conflict," HHS ASPR said.

"Nation-state threat actors, sympathetic hacking groups, ransomware groups, and other cyberthreat actors seek to take advantage of known conflicts," the advisory said.

"Iranian government-affiliated cyberthreat actors, in particular, have been known to utilize brute force methods, such as password spraying and multi-factor authentication 'push bombing', to compromise networks and obtain credentials," authorities warn.

DDoS attacks, spear-phishing, exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities and leveraging multiple open-source tools are also common tactics that have been observed, HHS ASPR said.

The interconnected nature of the healthcare and public health sector infrastructure especially puts organizations at risk, HHS ASPR said.

"All owners and operators of HPH infrastructure, regardless of size, should review their vulnerability management strategy and contingency planning."

Organizations should take crucial actions including access restrictions, implementation of intrusion detection systems, and regular backup of critical assets, HHS ASPR said.

The HHS ASPR alert follows warnings issued in recent days from multiple other U.S. government agencies, including the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (see: Warnings Ratchet Up Over Iranian Cyberattacks).

The Department of Homeland Security on Sunday issued a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin following the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. That NTAS bulletin, which is effective through Sept. 22, also warns that both hacktivists and Iranian government-affiliated actors routinely target "poorly secured U.S. networks and internet-connected devices for disruptive cyberattacks."

HHS ASPR said two previously released joint U.S. government agency alerts pertaining to Iranian cyberthreats, including one on brute force attacks and another on advanced persistent threat group MuddyWater, are still relevant to the current geopolitical climate (see: Feds Warn of Iranian Threats to Healthcare Sector).

DHS' most recent alert also warns that cyber risk may escalate if Iran's leadership issues religious decrees against U.S. targets.

"Iranian hacktivist groups may be operating more closely with state entities as Iran explores asymmetric responses to U.S. and Israeli actions," said Phil Englert, vice president of medical device security at the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

"This includes state-backed hacktivism, where pro-Iranian groups receive tools and resources from Iranian nation-state actors. Conversely, Iranian state-sponsored groups may pose as hacktivists to obscure attribution while targeting U.S. and Israeli critical infrastructure."

Iran may support sympathetic hacktivist groups or create fake ones as fronts for state operations. One example is CyberAv3ngers, suspected of ties to Iran's military, which attacked U.S. water treatment PLCs made by Israeli firm Unitronics in late 2023, he said.

APT35, a known Iranian threat actor, has conducted operations disguised as grassroots activism to complicate attribution, he said.
