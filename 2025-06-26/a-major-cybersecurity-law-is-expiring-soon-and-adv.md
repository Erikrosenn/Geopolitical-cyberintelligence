A push is gearing up to renew an expiring 10-year-old cybersecurity law that was viewed at its initial passage as the most significant cybersecurity legislation Congress had ever passed, and that advocates say now fosters several important threat-sharing initiatives.

The 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act provides safeguards for companies that voluntarily share threat intelligence data with the government or each other, such as federal antitrust exemptions and shields against state and federal disclosure laws.

Reauthorization of the law faces several hurdles, including uncertainty about who will take the lead on the bill in the House and Senate, potential privacy concerns, a tight timeline, and other competing priorities. There are also some who believe the law could use updates to fit today’s threats, potentially introducing further complications.

But its renewal has some bipartisan support, including among leaders of committees important to its passage, and there is optimism among outside groups that it can win congressional approval. The push is in the very early stages, but there’s a “growing recognition” that it needs to be reauthorized, said Matthew Eggers, vice president of cybersecurity policy in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s cyber, intelligence and security division.

“We’re in a little bit of spring training in the sense that we haven’t advocated for this legislation for about 10-plus years,” he said. “A number of organizations, over the last 10 years, have probably taken for granted the work that’s been done to get the legislation passed.”

The 2015 law — often called “2015 CISA” to differentiate it from the agency with the same acronym, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency — evolved from earlier bills, namely an effort that began in 2009 and culminated in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt in 2012 to pass “comprehensive, bipartisan cybersecurity legislation.”

Lawmakers then turned their attention to an industry-supported element of the legislation: information sharing. It moved through the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2014, then again in 2015, before gaining passage on the Senate floor by a 74-21 vote.  It was then inserted into an annual spending bill, which President Barack Obama signed into law that December.

Those who opposed the bill said it contained inadequate privacy protections, fearing what kind of personal data would end up in government hands. One of the biggest opponents then was Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who now chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that may end up playing a key role in the fate of the law’s renewal.

Eggers said a “notable accomplishment” of the law is that there’s no real evidence that those privacy concerns have played out as feared.

One group that criticized the 2015 legislation, the Center for Democracy and Technology, said it still is concerned about the privacy ramifications, especially with the haphazard handling of private data under the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency.

“The concerns are the same, but the data privacy environment is much more ominous,” said Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the group’s security and surveillance project. “Our sensitive and revealing data is generated more frequently, sought out and sold off more aggressively by data brokers, and now often churned through AI systems with an endless appetite.”

“Renewing this authority will require a lot of trust, right now it’s a big question of whether the government will earn it,” he added.

After the 2015 law passed, the Homeland Security Department established the Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) program. That program has been the subject of  often-negative watchdog reports, with the most recent one published in September noting that the number of participants fell to the lowest levels since 2017 in the period it reviewed, from 304 in 2020 to 135 in 2022. The number of actual threat indicators, like malicious IP addresses, fell precipitously to 93%, according to the DHS inspector general.

The report faulted the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency’s recruitment strategy for the dropoff in participants, and the dropoff in indicators on an unnamed federal agency that stopped sharing with the program over “unspecified security concerns.”

Advocates of renewing the 2015 law say some criticisms of the DHS program are fair, while others are misleading, but that the law’s importance isn’t tied to the AIS program created in its wake.

Eggers said that some companies haven’t seen enough high-quality threat information coming back from the program to justify participation. But he said the membership numbers are deceptive, since sector-specific industry information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) might count as one member, but have thousands of companies who benefit from the program.

Kemba Walden, a former attorney at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and later the acting national cyber director, said during her time at the agency some sectors made good use of the program, such as energy, transportation and financial services.
